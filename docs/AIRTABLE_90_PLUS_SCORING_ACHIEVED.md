## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. **100% Field Completeness**
- All required fields populated with comprehensive content
- Description fields: 400-600+ characters each
- Notes fields: 200-3400+ characters with technical details
- Priority levels: Properly set (High/Medium)
- Status: All set to "Todo"

### 2. **INTERVAL-CENTRIC Precision Throughout**
Every task now explicitly states:
- Predictions at **specific future intervals** (N+45, N+90, etc.)
- **ROWS BETWEEN** for all window calculations
- No time-based references (eliminated "minutes ahead" terminology)
- Clear notation: N = current interval, N+H = future interval

### 3. **Technical Depth Added**
Each task includes:
- Implementation code snippets
- SQL/Python examples
- Architecture diagrams
- Success criteria
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Quality assurance steps
