## ANALYSIS PROTOCOLS

### Performance Analysis Framework
```
For each model/horizon:
├── Accuracy metrics (overall, called, coverage)
├── AUC and calibration scores
├── Confidence distribution analysis
├── Walk-forward stability check
├── Comparison to baseline and targets
└── Recommendation: PASS / TUNE / INVESTIGATE
```

### Cost Allocation Breakdown
```
Monthly cost report:
├── Storage costs by dataset
├── Query costs by operation type
├── Compute costs (if applicable)
├── Top 10 cost drivers
├── Cost per table created
└── Cost per model trained
```

### Workflow Mapping
```
Current vs Optimized:
├── Step count reduction
├── Parallel opportunity identification
├── Bottleneck removal
├── Automation candidates
└── Estimated time savings
```
