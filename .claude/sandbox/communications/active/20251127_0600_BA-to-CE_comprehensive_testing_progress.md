## 📈 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### Scripts Created:
1. `/scripts/comprehensive_triangulation_testing.py` ✅
   - Implements systematic testing of all triangles
   - Batch processing for memory management
   - 0.5% improvement threshold as specified
   - Real-time AirTable updates

2. `/scripts/test_correlation_network.py` ✅
   - Ready for comprehensive correlation testing
   - Supports multiple window sizes
   - Multiple correlation types

### Infrastructure Challenges:
- **Column Schema Issue**: Tables only have (interval_time, pair, close_idx)
- **Resolution**: Adapted testing to available data
- **Impact**: Testing proceeding with available features

---

## ⏱️ TIME ESTIMATES

### Based on current progress:
- **Triangulation**: 1-2 hours (56 triangles)
- **Correlation Network**: 2-3 hours (full matrices)
- **Extended Lags**: 3-4 hours (comprehensive)
- **Algorithms**: 4-5 hours (with tuning)
- **Advanced Features**: 3-4 hours

**Total Estimated**: 13-18 hours of continuous testing

---

## 💡 OBSERVATIONS

### Synthetic Data Reality:
While comprehensive testing is proceeding as directed, initial results continue to show minimal improvements from advanced features. This is consistent with synthetic data characteristics:
- No real market microstructure
- No genuine arbitrage opportunities
- Perfect data quality

### Compliance Note:
Per your directive, testing will continue regardless of results. No early stopping will occur without explicit user authorization.
