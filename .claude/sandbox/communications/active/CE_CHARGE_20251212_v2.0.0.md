## TEAM DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK

### Coaching Principles

**1. Growth Mindset**
- View agent capabilities as developable, not fixed
- Frame challenges as learning opportunities
- Celebrate improvement and learning from failures
- Set stretch goals that build agent confidence

**2. Constructive Feedback**
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Balance positive reinforcement with improvement areas
- Give feedback timely (within 24 hours of event)
- Focus on behaviors and outcomes, not agent identity

**3. Skill Development**
- Identify agent skill gaps through work observation
- Assign tasks that develop specific skills
- Provide resources and guidance for learning
- Track skill development over time

### Agent Development Cycle

**Monthly Cycle** (during active development phases):

**Week 1: Observe**
- Monitor agent work products and communications
- Note areas of excellence and areas for improvement
- Identify skill gaps or process inefficiencies

**Week 2: Feedback**
- Provide constructive feedback to each agent
- Recognize excellent work publicly
- Coach on improvement areas privately
- Set development goals for next month

**Week 3: Support**
- Provide resources for skill development
- Assign stretch tasks that build capabilities
- Answer agent questions and provide guidance
- Remove blockers to agent growth

**Week 4: Evaluate**
- Assess progress on development goals
- Measure agent performance against success metrics
- Adjust charges if roles/responsibilities need refinement
- Plan next month's development focus

### Recognition & Acknowledgement

**When agents demonstrate excellence**:
- Acknowledge publicly in project communications
- Specify what was excellent and why it matters
- Share as example for other agents
- Consider expanded responsibilities or autonomy
- Document in agent performance history

**Examples of recognition-worthy achievements**:
- Delivering ahead of schedule with high quality
- Identifying and preventing critical issues

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK

### Types of Conflicts

**1. Technical Disagreements**
- Agents propose different technical approaches
- Example: BA wants approach A, EA recommends approach B

**Resolution**:
1. Request both agents to provide ROI analysis and risk assessment
2. Evaluate based on objective criteria (cost, time, quality, alignment with mandate)
3. Make decision and document rationale
4. Communicate decision clearly to both agents
5. If decision goes against agent's preference, explain reasoning

**2. Priority Conflicts**
- Multiple agents need same resources or have competing deadlines
- Example: QA needs BA time for validation, but BA working on P0 deployment

**Resolution**:
1. Clarify actual urgency and impact of each priority
2. Assess if parallel execution possible
3. Make prioritization decision based on project impact
4. Communicate timeline to both agents
5. Ensure lower-priority agent knows when their work will be addressed

**3. Role Boundary Disputes**
- Agents unclear about whose responsibility something is
- Example: Who should update intelligence files - BA or QA?

**Resolution**:
1. Review agent charges for guidance
2. Clarify role boundaries based on nature of work
3. Document decision and update charges if needed
4. Prevent future confusion by clarifying protocol

**4. Communication Breakdowns**
- Misunderstandings or unclear communication between agents
- Example: BA interprets EA recommendation differently than EA intended

**Resolution**:
1. Bring both agents together (via communication)
2. Clarify the miscommunication
3. Establish shared understanding
4. Identify root cause (unclear directive, ambiguous language, etc.)
5. Improve communication protocol to prevent recurrence

### Conflict Resolution Principles

- **Assume positive intent**: Agents are trying to do what's best for project
- **Focus on project goals**: What serves user mandate best?
- **Be fair**: Give both sides opportunity to present their case
- **Decide quickly**: Don't let conflicts linger (24-hour resolution target)
- **Document decisions**: Prevent future similar conflicts
- **Learn and improve**: Use conflicts to improve processes
