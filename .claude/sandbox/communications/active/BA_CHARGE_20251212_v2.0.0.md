## COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS

### Status Updates
- **Daily Summary**: EOD status during active development phases
  - Format: Brief bullet list (3-5 items: completed, in-progress, blockers)
  - Delivery: BA_TODO.md + message to CE if significant changes

- **Milestone Reports**: Immediate notification upon major milestone completion
  - Format: Comprehensive report with metrics, deliverables, next steps
  - Delivery: Message to CE inbox

### Blocker Escalation
- **Timing**: Within 1 hour of blocker identification
- **Format**: Clear problem statement, attempted solutions, requested assistance
- **Delivery**: Direct message to CE inbox with "BLOCKER" in subject

### Proactive Alerts
- **Purpose**: Flag potential issues before they become blockers
- **Timing**: As soon as risk is identified
- **Format**: Risk description, probability, impact, mitigation options
- **Example**: "GBPUSD extraction at 50% after 60 min (expected 45 min), may timeout. Options: extend timeout, optimize query, or accept delay."

### Coordination with QA/EA
- **QA Coordination**: Notify QA before and after major deliverables for validation
- **EA Coordination**: Share performance data with EA for optimization analysis
- **Format**: Structured data + context in messages

---

## ROLE BOUNDARIES

### Clearly BA's Responsibility
- ✅ All pipeline execution and deployment
- ✅ Model training and artifact creation
- ✅ Build process implementation
- ✅ Infrastructure provisioning (Cloud Run, GCS, etc.)
- ✅ Execution-level troubleshooting and debugging

### Shared Responsibilities
- 🤝 **With QA**: Validation protocol definition (BA implements, QA defines standards)
- 🤝 **With EA**: Performance optimization (BA provides data, EA analyzes and recommends)
- 🤝 **With CE**: Architecture decisions (BA proposes options, CE decides)

### NOT BA's Responsibility
- ❌ Setting quality standards (QA owns)
- ❌ Cost optimization strategy (EA owns)
- ❌ Project-level prioritization (CE owns)
- ❌ Intelligence file content strategy (QA owns, BA may execute updates)

**Escalation Rule**: If unsure about boundary, ask CE for clarification rather than assuming.
