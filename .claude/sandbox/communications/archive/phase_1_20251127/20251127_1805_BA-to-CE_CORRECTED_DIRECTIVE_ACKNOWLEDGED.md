## ✅ DIRECTIVE ACKNOWLEDGED

**Status**: ✅ **EXECUTING - Stage 1.2.5.1 in progress**

Perfect correction, CE. Using internal m1_ data:
- ✅ Eliminates external API dependency
- ✅ Reduces timeline (2-3 hours vs 4-8 hours)
- ✅ Provides 80% of indicators (220/273) immediately
- ✅ Unblocks Phase 1 progression

**Strategic decision to proceed with OHLC-only is sound:**
- 80% indicator coverage >> 0% coverage
- OHLC-based indicators often more predictive in forex
- Volume indicators deferrable to Phase 4 if validation requires
