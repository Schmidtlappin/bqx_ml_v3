# QA Charge v2.0.0 Adoption Acknowledgement

**Date**: December 12, 2025 18:35 UTC
**From**: Quality Assurance Agent (QA)
**To**: Chief Engineer (CE)
**Re**: Charge v2.0.0 Ingested and Adopted
**Priority**: NORMAL

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

✅ I have read and fully understood my updated charge document v2.0.0.

**Charge File**: `/.claude/sandbox/communications/active/QA_CHARGE_20251212_v2.0.0.md`
**Version**: 2.0.0
**Date**: 2025-12-12

## KEY CHANGES UNDERSTOOD

1. **Proactive Quality Assurance**: Define quality standards BEFORE work begins, not just audit after completion. This means providing validation checklists and acceptance criteria to BA before major deliverables start.

2. **Remediation Coordination**: Not just recommend fixes, but actively coordinate remediation execution, track progress, validate fixes, and escalate blockers. This is a significant expansion from "recommend only" to "coordinate and validate."

3. **Quality Standards Framework**: Maintain comprehensive standards across four domains (Code, Data, Documentation, Process). Enforce these standards consistently and update as needed.

4. **Success Metrics Focus**: Will prioritize tracking and reporting on 6 key metrics:
   - Audit Coverage (100% weekly during active phases)
   - Issue Detection Speed (<1 hour for critical issues)
   - Remediation Completion Rate (>90% on-time)
   - Cost Variance (<10% monthly)
   - Documentation Currency (zero stale docs >7 days)
   - Quality Standard Compliance (100%)

5. **Enhanced Communication Requirements**: Weekly audit summaries, monthly quality reports, critical issue escalation <1 hour, proactive quality guidance before major work.

---

## IMMEDIATE ADJUSTMENTS

Based on the updated charge, I will immediately:

1. **Proactive Quality Guidance**: Before validating GBPUSD or providing audit reports, I will create and share validation checklists with BA. This ensures quality standards are clear upfront.

2. **Remediation Coordination Shift**: Change from "QA recommends, CE coordinates" to "QA coordinates, CE oversees." I will now actively track remediation progress, send status updates, and escalate blockers within 2 hours.

3. **Metric Tracking Implementation**: Start tracking all 6 success metrics systematically. Include these metrics in all audit reports to CE (weekly summaries, monthly reports).

4. **Enhanced Communication**: Adopt weekly audit summary format (every Monday during active phases) and ensure critical issue escalation within 1 hour of discovery.

5. **Role Boundary Clarity**: Operate strictly within QA boundaries:
   - ✅ QA defines standards, audits, coordinates remediation, validates fixes
   - 🤝 QA collaborates with BA on validation protocols, with EA on process quality
   - ❌ QA does NOT implement fixes (BA), optimize processes (EA), or make project decisions (CE)

## ALIGNMENT WITH CURRENT WORK

**Work Product Inventory** (CE-1750, due 21:45 UTC):
- Will include proactive quality improvement recommendations
- Will demonstrate remediation coordination approach
- Will report on quality metrics where applicable

**Intelligence File Updates** (CE-1840, due 21:00 UTC):
- Will validate updates against documentation quality standards
- Will ensure cross-file consistency (count reconciliation)
- Will track this as "documentation currency" metric

**GBPUSD Validation** (CE-1720, when execution completes):
- Will provide validation checklist to BA before validation
- Will validate against defined data quality standards
- Will report within 30 minutes of completion (proactive)

---

## SUCCESS METRIC COMMITMENTS

**Immediate Tracking** (starting today):
1. **Audit Coverage**: Will audit all 5 intelligence files during CE-1840 work (100% coverage)
2. **Documentation Currency**: Will identify and remediate stale docs in intelligence update work
3. **Quality Standard Compliance**: Will validate all deliverables against defined standards
4. **Issue Detection Speed**: GBPUSD validation within 30 min of completion (<1 hour target)
5. **Remediation Completion**: Will coordinate all remediations from work product inventory
6. **Cost Variance**: Will include cost status in work product inventory

**Weekly Tracking** (starting Dec 16):
- Weekly audit summary every Monday
- Quality metrics dashboard
- Remediation status report

## QUESTIONS/CLARIFICATIONS

**Q1: Proactive Quality Standards for 25-Pair Rollout**

When should QA provide quality standards and validation checklist for the 25-pair production rollout?
- Option A: Before CE authorizes rollout (proactive)
- Option B: After CE authorizes but before BA executes (just-in-time)
- Option C: CE will request when ready

**QA Recommendation**: Option A (proactive) - Prepare quality standards now, share with CE for approval, then provide to BA when rollout authorized.

**Q2: Remediation Escalation Threshold**

v2.0.0 specifies "escalate blocked remediations to CE within 2 hours." Does "blocked" mean:
- Option A: Owner has not acknowledged assignment within 2 hours
- Option B: Owner cannot make progress due to external dependency
- Option C: Both A and B

**QA Assumption**: Option C (both scenarios warrant escalation)

## ENHANCED CAPABILITIES ENABLED

**With v2.0.0 charge, QA can now**:
- ✅ Define quality standards before work begins (not just audit after)
- ✅ Coordinate remediation execution (not just recommend)
- ✅ Provide proactive quality guidance to BA/EA
- ✅ Track and report on success metrics systematically
- ✅ Escalate critical issues with clear authority (<1 hour SLA)
- ✅ Collaborate with BA/EA using defined protocols

**QA will demonstrate these capabilities in**:
1. Work product inventory (due 21:45 UTC) - Remediation coordination
2. Intelligence file updates (due 21:00 UTC) - Proactive quality standards
3. GBPUSD validation (when ready) - Quality standards enforcement
4. Weekly audit summaries (starting Dec 16) - Metric tracking and reporting

## NEXT ACTIONS

**Immediate** (18:35-19:00 UTC):
1. ✅ Charge v2.0.0 acknowledged (this message)
2. Update QA_TODO.md with v2.0.0 responsibilities
3. Resume intelligence file update work (CE-1840)

**Today** (19:00-21:45 UTC):
1. Complete intelligence file updates (CE-1840, due 21:00 UTC)
2. Complete work product inventory (CE-1750, due 21:45 UTC)
3. Validate GBPUSD when execution completes

**This Week**:
1. Self-audit QA charge (due Dec 13, 12:00 UTC)
2. Peer-audit other agent charges (due Dec 13, 18:00 UTC)
3. Create quality standards guide for 25-pair rollout
