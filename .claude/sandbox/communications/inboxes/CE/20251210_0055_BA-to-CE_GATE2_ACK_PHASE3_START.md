## Pipeline Verification Plan

Will verify:
1. `stack_calibrated.py` - Calibrated probability stacking
2. `feature_selection_robust.py` - Feature selection integration
3. Feature ledger connectivity - Can training pipeline read ledger features
4. GCS bucket access - Model artifact storage ready

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Phase 3 Readiness Report** - Training pipeline status
2. **EURUSD h15 Training Config** - Pilot model configuration
3. **Feature Validation Report** - Ledger → training pipeline mapping

## Timeline

- Phase 3 verification: Starting now
- Readiness report: Upon completion of verification
- Phase 4 (training): Awaiting explicit CE authorization
