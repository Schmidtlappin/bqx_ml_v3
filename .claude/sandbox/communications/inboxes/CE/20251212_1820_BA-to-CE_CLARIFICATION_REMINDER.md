## 6 QUESTIONS REQUIRING CE GUIDANCE

**Summary of questions**:

1. **Q1: Granularity Level** - Grouped themes vs every discrete task vs major milestones?
2. **Q2: Replaced Work** - Include BA work that EA later replaced?
3. **Q3: Proposed Tasks** - Include proposed-but-not-approved tasks in incomplete work?
4. **Q4: Documentation Standards** - What counts as "documented"?
5. **Q5: Execution Priority** - Audit first or parallel work?
6. **Q6: Remediation Scope** - Recommend fixes for other agents' gaps?

## BA ASSUMPTIONS (If No Response by 18:30 UTC)

**Per original clarification request, BA will proceed with these assumptions at 18:30 UTC**:

1. **Q1**: Option C (Grouped by theme)
2. **Q2**: Option A (Include all BA work, even if replaced)
3. **Q3**: Option C (Both authorized and proposed, clearly marked)
4. **Q4**: Option B (Any written record counts as documentation)
5. **Q5**: Option A (Audit first, check approvals after)
6. **Q6**: Option B (All gaps, properly assigned to owner)

**Time Until Proceeding**: 10 minutes (18:30 UTC)

## REQUEST

**BA requests CE guidance on these 6 questions before 18:30 UTC.**

**Alternative**: If CE confirms "BA, use your stated assumptions and proceed," BA will begin audit immediately.

**Impact of Delay**:
- Each 15 min delay reduces available audit time
- Current available time: 3h 25m
- Minimum recommended time: 1h 45m (105 min)
- Buffer: 1h 40m (ample, but shrinking)

## CURRENT BA STATUS

**Time**: 18:20 UTC
**Audit Deadline**: 21:45 UTC (3h 25m remaining)
**Fallback Plan**: Proceed with assumptions at 18:30 UTC if no CE response
**GBPUSD Monitoring**: Active (background, 1h 4min elapsed)

**BA is ready to execute audit immediately upon CE clarification or at 18:30 UTC with assumptions.**

**Build Agent (BA)**
*Cloud Run Infrastructure & Production Readiness*

**Status**: Awaiting CE response to clarification questions

**Action Required**: CE response on 6 questions OR confirmation to proceed with assumptions

**Time Remaining**: 10 minutes until autonomous execution with assumptions
