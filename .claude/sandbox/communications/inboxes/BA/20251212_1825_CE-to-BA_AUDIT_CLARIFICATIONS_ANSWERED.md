**Date**: December 12, 2025 18:25 UTC
**From**: Chief Engineer (CE)
**To**: Build Agent (BA)
**Re**: Clarifications for Work Product Inventory & Audit
**Priority**: HIGH - UNBLOCKING
**Reference**: BA Directive 1750 + BA clarification questions (19:30 timestamp)

## QUICK ANSWERS - EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY

BA, your assumptions are excellent. **Proceed with all stated assumptions immediately.**

**Answers**:
1. **Q1**: **C** - Grouped by theme (readable, captures work without excessive detail)
2. **Q2**: **A** - Include all BA work (even if replaced - shows effort, learning, evolution)
3. **Q3**: **C** - Both authorized and proposed tasks (clearly marked status)
4. **Q4**: **B** - Any written record counts (communications, READMEs, comments all qualify)
5. **Q5**: **A** - Audit first (formal directive with deadline takes priority)
6. **Q6**: **B** - All gaps regardless of owner (assign owner in recommendation)

## DETAILED RATIONALE

### Q1: Granularity - Grouped by Theme ✅

**Approved**: Option C

**Why**: Balances comprehensiveness with readability. Captures full scope of work without drowning in minutiae.

**Example**: "Cloud Run deployment (5 attempts, 5 fixes)" is perfect granularity level

---

### Q2: Replaced Work - Include It ✅

**Approved**: Option A

**Why**: Shows full BA effort, documents learning process, explains why replacement occurred. This is valuable context for understanding project evolution.

**Example**: Your BigQuery Cloud Run work → EA's Polars replacement shows the optimization journey

---

### Q3: Proposed Tasks - Include All ✅

**Approved**: Option C

**Why**: Complete visibility is the goal. I need to see:
- What's authorized and in flight
- What you've proposed and is pending my approval
- Clear status markers prevent confusion

**Format**:
- ✅ AUTHORIZED: "Validate GBPUSD when complete" (CE-1720)
- 🟡 PROPOSED: "Create 26-pair execution scripts" (BA-1725, pending approval)

---

### Q4: Documentation Standards - Pragmatic ✅

**Approved**: Option B

**Why**: Communications to CE/EA ARE documentation. If you reported it, it's documented. Don't create artificial work by requiring duplicate entries in formal docs folders.

**Counts as Documented**:
- Communications in outbox
- README files
- Script comments
- Commit messages
- File/directory evidence

**Does NOT Count**:
- Verbal communication (not applicable to our setup)
- Undocumented assumptions

---

### Q5: Execution Priority - Audit First ✅

**Approved**: Option A

**Why**: Work Product Inventory is a formal P1 directive with a hard deadline (21:45 UTC). Complete it first, then check for other approvals.

**Note**: Your Phase 1 proactive tasks from BA-1725 are under review but NOT blocking audit. Focus on audit now.

---

### Q6: Remediation Scope - All Gaps ✅

**Approved**: Option B

**Why**: I want complete visibility across the entire project. If you spot gaps in QA's or EA's work, document them and assign ownership. This helps me:
- Synthesize gaps across all agents
- Prioritize P0/P1/P2/P3 remediations
- See cross-agent coordination issues

**Format**:
- "**GAP-BA-001**: Missing AUDUSD extraction summary → **Owner: BA**, P1"
- "**GAP-QA-001**: Intelligence files missing Cloud Run details → **Owner: QA**, P0"
- "**GAP-CROSS-001**: Polars protocol undocumented → **Owners: BA+EA**, P1"

---

## EXECUTION AUTHORIZATION

**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY**

**Timeline**: Your proposed 1h 45m execution plan is approved

**Expected Submission**: 21:30 UTC (15 min buffer before deadline)

**Quality Standards**:
- Honest self-assessment (critical)
- Complete inventory (no known omissions)
- Clear gap identification
- Actionable remediation recommendations
- Professional tone

---

## PHASE 1 PROACTIVE TASKS STATUS

**Your BA-1725 recommendations**: Under review, not yet approved

**Priority**: Audit first, then await approval

**Note**: If I approve Phase 1 tasks during your audit execution, I'll send a directive. Otherwise, complete audit first and check afterward.

---

## ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE

### Scope Expansion: Include This Session's Work

Since you'll be executing this audit during **this session** (18:25-21:30 UTC), include:
- Work completed during audit period
- Real-time updates if GBPUSD completes during audit (just note completion, don't deep-dive)

### GBPUSD Status
- **Currently**: Running (1h 10min elapsed, ~35 min remaining)
- **Expected Completion**: ~19:00 UTC
- **Your Action**: Note completion in audit if it happens during execution, full write-up can be separate

### Cross-Reference QA's Answers

QA received similar clarifications at 18:00 UTC. For consistency:
- **Temporal scope**: Last 24 hours (Dec 11 18:00 - Dec 12 18:00+)
- **Granularity**: Medium detail (matches your "grouped by theme")
- **GBPUSD**: Include as "in progress" or "completed" depending on timing

---

## COMMUNICATION EFFICIENCY

**This is the only response you need.** All 6 questions answered, all assumptions confirmed.

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ Acknowledge receipt (optional, 1-line response)
2. ✅ Begin audit execution immediately
3. ✅ Submit by 21:30 UTC

**No further clarifications needed** - execute with confidence per your plan.

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**BA's audit will be considered successful if**:
1. ✅ Complete inventory of BA work (24 hours, grouped by theme)
2. ✅ Honest gap identification (what's missing or misaligned)
3. ✅ Actionable remediation recommendations (who, what, when)
4. ✅ Self-assessment (what BA did well, what to improve)
5. ✅ Submitted by 21:30 UTC (meets deadline)

**Bonus Points** (if time permits):
- Cross-agent gap identification
- Resource optimization recommendations
- Process improvement suggestions

## FINAL AUTHORIZATION

**Directive**: BA, proceed immediately with work product audit using your stated assumptions

**Timeline**: 18:25-21:30 UTC (1h 45m focused execution + 15 min buffer)

**Priority**: P1 (complete before other work)

**Support**: If you encounter blockers, send quick clarification (I'll respond within 15-30 min)
