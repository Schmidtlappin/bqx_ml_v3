## PRIORITY 1 - IMMEDIATE (Execute Now)

### T1: EA-002 - Higher Confidence Threshold Testing
- **Status**: AUTHORIZED - EXECUTE NOW
- **Priority**: P1
- **Effort**: 30-60 minutes
- **Description**: Test τ=0.75 and τ=0.80 thresholds on EURUSD h15 data

**Scope**:
1. Load existing calibrated_stack_eurusd_h15.json results
2. Calculate accuracy and coverage for τ=0.75
3. Calculate accuracy and coverage for τ=0.80
4. Generate accuracy vs coverage curve (τ=0.55 to τ=0.85)
5. Identify optimal operating point for 85%+ accuracy

**Expected Output**:
```
| Threshold | Accuracy | Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| τ=0.70    | 82.52%   | 78.84%   | Current |
| τ=0.75    | ~84-85%  | ~65-70%  | Test |
| τ=0.80    | ~86-88%  | ~50-55%  | Test |
```

**Deliverable**: EA-002 results report with recommendation

**Success Criteria**: Identify threshold achieving ≥85% called accuracy within 50% coverage

## PRIORITY 2 - HIGH (After EA-002 Complete)

### T2: EA-001 - ElasticNet Removal and Retest
- **Status**: PENDING (after T1)
- **Priority**: P2
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Description**: Remove ElasticNet from ensemble and retest

**Scope**:
1. Modify stack_calibrated.py to exclude ElasticNet
2. Re-run training on EURUSD h15 data
3. Compare results (with vs without ElasticNet)
4. Document root cause briefly (1 hour max investigation)

**Brief Investigation Items** (do not exceed 1 hour):
- Check feature scaling applied to ElasticNet
- Check regularization parameters
- Check if linear model appropriate for this feature set

**Expected Outcome**:
- +1-2% accuracy improvement from removing noise source
- Simplified ensemble (3 models instead of 4)
- Documented root cause for future reference

**Deliverable**: EA-001 results report with before/after comparison

---

### T3: Coordinate with QA on F3 Findings
- **Status**: PENDING (after QA T5)
- **Priority**: P2
- **Effort**: 30 minutes
- **Description**: Review QA's BigQuery table variance findings for cost implications

**Scope**:
1. Receive F3 investigation results from QA
2. Analyze cost impact of extra tables
3. Recommend optimization if warranted (deletion, archival)
4. Coordinate with QA on recommendations

**Deliverable**: Cost optimization recommendations (if applicable)

---

## PRIORITY 3 - NORMAL (After Phase 1.5 Checkpoints)

### T4: EA-003 - Feature-View Diversity Specification
- **Status**: PENDING (after T2 resolves)
- **Priority**: P3
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Description**: Create detailed feature-view assignment specification

**Prerequisites**:
- EA-001 complete (ElasticNet fate decided)
- Phase 1.5 gap remediation at 50%+ completion

**Specification Requirements**:
1. Assign features to each base model
2. Ensure views are mutually exclusive where possible
3. Minimum 100 features per view
4. Document rationale for each assignment

**Proposed Feature Views** (to be refined):
```
LightGBM:   Target-history (lags, rolling stats) - ~200 features
XGBoost:    Returns/volatility (multi-horizon, ATR, range) - ~200 features
CatBoost:   Cross-pair/microstructure (spreads, correlations) - ~200 features
[ElasticNet: All features OR removed - TBD by EA-001]
```

**Deliverable**: Feature-view specification document for CE approval

---

### T5: Performance Trend Tracking Setup
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Priority**: P3
- **Effort**: 2 hours
- **Description**: Establish accuracy tracking across horizons and pairs

**Scope**:
1. Create tracking template for model performance
2. Define metrics to track (AUC, accuracy, coverage)
3. Establish baseline from EURUSD h15 results
4. Prepare for 784-model tracking

**Deliverable**: Performance tracking template and baseline document

---

## PRIORITY 4 - LOW (This Week)

### T6: Cost Intelligence Report
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Priority**: P4
- **Effort**: 2 hours
- **Description**: Monthly BigQuery cost analysis

**Scope**:
1. Analyze current storage costs by dataset
2. Identify unused tables (if any)
3. Recommend storage optimizations
4. Project costs for Phase 4-5 training

**Current Baseline**:
- Storage: $33.88/month (12% of $277 budget)
- V1 deletion saved: $49.98/month
- Expected increase: Phase 4-5 training

**Deliverable**: Cost intelligence report with recommendations

### T7: Workspace Organization Review
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Priority**: P4
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Description**: Review workspace for organization improvements

**Scope**:
1. Review file structure
2. Identify stale or redundant files (coordinate with QA)
3. Recommend archive candidates
4. Propose naming convention improvements

**Coordination**: QA is updating README files; coordinate on recommendations

**Deliverable**: Workspace organization recommendations

### T8: Agent Communication Optimization
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Priority**: P4
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Description**: Analyze CE-BA-QA-EA communication patterns

**Scope**:
1. Review communication patterns from today
