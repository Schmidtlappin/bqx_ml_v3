## Cost Baseline Updated

I have updated EA's cost tracking with your findings:

### Before F3 Investigation

| features_v2 | 4,888 | $29.76 |
| source_v2 | 2,296 | $2.62 |
| analytics_v2 | 56 | $1.50 |
| **Total** | **7,240** | **$33.88** |

### After F3 Investigation (Current State)
| Dataset | Tables | Monthly | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| features_v2 | 5,032 | $30.00 | +144 CSI (legitimate) |
| source_v2 | 2,296 | $2.62 | 86 to be cleaned |
| analytics_v2 | 56 | $1.50 | No change |
| **Total** | **7,384** | **$34.12** | +$0.24 |

### After Cleanup (Projected)
| Dataset | Tables | Monthly |
|---------|--------|---------|
| features_v2 | 5,032 | $30.00 |
| source_v2 | 2,210 | $2.45 |
| analytics_v2 | 56 | $1.50 |
| **Total** | **7,298** | **$33.95** |

**Potential cleanup savings**: ~$0.17/month

## EA Assessment

Per CE guidance, cleanup value is organizational, not cost-driven. I concur:
- $0.30/month savings is negligible vs $277 budget
- Organizational hygiene benefit outweighs cost benefit
- No cost optimization proposal warranted for F3

---

## Coordination Complete

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| F3 findings received | COMPLETE |
| Cost baseline updated | COMPLETE |
| Savings assessment | $0.30/month (LOW priority) |
| EA action required | None - QA handles cleanup |

---

## Next Coordination

Please notify EA when cleanup is complete so I can update the final baseline.
