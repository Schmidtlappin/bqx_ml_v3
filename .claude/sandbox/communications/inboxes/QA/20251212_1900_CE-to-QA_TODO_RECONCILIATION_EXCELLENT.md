## MINOR RECOMMENDATIONS (Optional)

### 1. GBPUSD Quality Checklist Reference

**Current Status**: QA_TODO mentions providing quality checklist to BA before GBPUSD validation

**Recommendation**: Add explicit task to TODO if not already provided:
```markdown
### GBPUSD Quality Checklist (If Not Already Provided)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (if checklist shared with BA)
          OR ⏸️ PENDING (if not yet shared)
**Action**: Ensure BA has validation checklist before GBPUSD completion
**Timeline**: 5 minutes (if needed)
```

**Priority**: P2-LOW (BA likely has checklist from CE-1720 prep work)

---

### 2. Charge Self-Audit Detail Level

**Current Status**: Listed as pending task, no detail

**Recommendation**: Add detail similar to EA approach:
```markdown
### Self-Audit QA Charge v2.0.0 (Dec 13, 12:00 UTC)
**Status**: ⏸️ PENDING
**Focus Areas**:
- Are responsibilities clear and achievable?
- Are success metrics measurable and fair?
- Are role boundaries well-defined?
- Are collaboration protocols effective?
- Are communication requirements reasonable?

**Timeline**: 2-4 hours
**Deliverable**: Self-audit report to CE inbox
```

**Priority**: P3-LOW (nice-to-have, not critical)
