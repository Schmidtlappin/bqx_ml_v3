## 📊 FULL MANDATE SCOPE

### Centric Breakdown

| Centric | Tables | Description | Priority |
|---------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Primary (Pair) | 392 | Per currency pair features | 1 |
| Variant (Family) | 112 | Currency family groupings | 2 |
| Covariant (Cross-Pair) | 800 | Cross-pair relationships | 3 |
| Triangulation | 288 | Triangular arbitrage features | 4 |
| Secondary (Currency) | 128 | Per currency aggregations | 5 |
| Tertiary (Market) | 16 | Market-wide features | 6 |
| **TOTAL** | **1,736** | **Full mandate** | |

### Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tables Built | 504 |

## 📋 REVISED EXECUTION APPROACH

### Recommended Strategy

**Phase 2A**: Complete Primary-Centric features (5 types × 112 tables = 560)
**Phase 2B**: Extend to Variant centric (112 tables)
**Phase 2C**: Extend to Covariant centric (800 tables)
**Phase 2D**: Extend to Triangulation (288 tables)
**Phase 2E**: Extend to Secondary centric (128 tables)
**Phase 2F**: Complete Tertiary centric (16 tables)

### Feature Types per Centric

Each centric should implement (as applicable):
1. REGRESSION features
2. AGGREGATION features
3. MOMENTUM features
4. VOLATILITY features
5. ALIGNMENT features

### Progressive Milestones

| Phase | Cumulative Tables | % Complete |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Current | 504 | 29% |
| After 2A | 1,064 | 61% |
| After 2B | 1,176 | 68% |
| After 2C | 1,976* | 100%+ |
| After 2D | Adjusted | - |
| After 2E | Adjusted | - |
| After 2F | 1,736 | 100% |

*Note: Actual table counts will depend on feature applicability per centric

## ⚡ EXECUTION AUTHORIZATION

**Approved Approach**:

1. ✅ Begin with Primary-Centric REGRESSION (as planned)
2. ✅ Complete all 5 feature types for Primary centric
3. ✅ Then extend each feature type to remaining centrics
4. ✅ Continue until 1,736 tables achieved

**Quality Requirements**:
- Dual architecture (IDX + BQX) where applicable
- Data parity validation after each batch
- Report progress at each centric completion

---

## 📬 REPORTING CADENCE

**Required Reports**:
1. After each feature type completion (Primary centric)
2. After each centric extension completion
3. Milestone reports at 50%, 75%, 100%
4. Immediate escalation on blockers

---

## 🚀 AUTHORIZATION

**Phase 2 Full Scope**: ✅ **AUTHORIZED**

**Immediate Action**: Begin REGRESSION feature implementation (Primary-Centric first)

**Target**: 1,736 tables (100% mandate compliance)
