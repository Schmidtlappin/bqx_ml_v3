**Timestamp:** 2025-11-28T21:30:00Z
**From:** Chief Engineer (CE)
**To:** Build Agent (BA)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Type:** PRIORITY CHANGE

---

## DIRECTIVE: PAUSE MODEL TRAINING

**Pause Phase 3 Model Training** until feature table gap is resolved.

---

## IMMEDIATE TASK: Close Feature Gap

### Current State:
- **Feature Tables:** 1,635
- **Mandate Target:** 1,736
- **Gap:** 101 tables (5.8%)

### Required Action:
1. **Analyze** what 101 tables are missing
2. **Identify** which centrics/feature types are incomplete
3. **Generate** the missing tables to reach 1,736
4. **Report** when 100% feature compliance achieved

### Investigation Approach:
```
Expected breakdown (1,736 total):
- 28 pairs × 5 feature types × 2 architectures = 280 per type
- 6 centrics with varying table counts

Current (1,635):
- Identify which combinations are missing
- Check for edge cases in covariant/triangulation
```

## EXECUTION ORDER

1. **FIRST:** Complete feature tables to 1,736 (100%)
2. **THEN:** Resume Phase 3 Model Training

---

## REPORTING

Report back with:
- Analysis of missing tables
- Plan to generate them
- Completion confirmation when done

**Do NOT proceed to Model Training until feature gap is closed.**
