## 📚 DOCUMENTS IN THIS DIRECTORY

### 1. [BQX_ML_V3_ARCHITECTURE_CONFIRMATION.md](BQX_ML_V3_ARCHITECTURE_CONFIRMATION.md)
**Size**: 22KB | **Lines**: 700+

**What it confirms:**
- ✅ 28 independent currency pair models
- ✅ 7 prediction horizons per model (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 intervals)
- ✅ Total: 784 models (28 pairs × 7 horizons × 4 ensemble members)
- ✅ Predicting future BQX momentum values (not raw prices)

**What it rationalizes:**
- Why 28 independent models (unique dynamics per pair, no cross-contamination)
- Why BQX targets (scale-invariant, stationary, trading-relevant)
- Why 7 horizons (different trading styles, multi-horizon consensus)
- Complete mathematical and business justification

**Use this when:** You need definitive confirmation of the overall system architecture

---

### 2. [IDX_BQX_DUAL_FEATURE_DEEP_DIVE.md](IDX_BQX_DUAL_FEATURE_DEEP_DIVE.md)
**Size**: 16KB | **Lines**: 600+

**What it confirms:**
- ✅ ALL features are derived from IDX and BQX only
- ✅ IDX = Indexed price data (OHLCV)
- ✅ BQX = Backward-looking momentum calculation
- ✅ NO external data sources

**What it explains:**
- What IDX is and how it's used
- What BQX is and how it's calculated
- The "dual" architecture (IDX + BQX features together)
- How technical indicators are derived FROM IDX
- Why dual outperforms single-source (32% improvement)
- Complete feature derivation pipeline

**Use this when:** You need to understand where ALL features come from and the dual processing architecture

---

### 3. [BQX_ML_V3_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md](BQX_ML_V3_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md)
**Size**: 17KB | **Lines**: 500+

**What it inventories:**
- ✅ 1,736 planned BigQuery tables
- ✅ 8,214+ features per pair (before selection)
- ✅ Feature matrix: 8 types × 6 centrics × 2 variants = 96 cell types
- ✅ 11-phase implementation plan (75 days)

**What it specifies:**
- Complete 3D feature matrix architecture
- All 8 feature types (regression, lag, regime, aggregation, alignment, correlation, momentum, volatility)
- All 6 centric perspectives (primary, variant, covariant, triangulation, secondary, tertiary)
- Expected features per model and across all pairs
- The 90%+ accuracy mandate (requires testing ALL features)

**Use this when:** You need to know what features exist, how many tables, and the implementation roadmap

## 🎯 WHY THESE ARE "MANDATE" DOCUMENTS

These documents represent **NON-NEGOTIABLE architectural decisions** that:

1. **Define the system structure** (28 models × 7 horizons)
2. **Establish data sources** (IDX and BQX only)
3. **Specify feature requirements** (1,736 tables, 8,214+ features)
4. **Set performance targets** (90%+ directional accuracy)
5. **Rationalize design decisions** (why not alternatives)

---

## 🔒 CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

### Independence
- 28 completely isolated currency pair models
- NO cross-contamination between pairs
- Each pair's unique dynamics captured

### Dual Architecture
- IDX (position) + BQX (momentum) together
- Complementary information sources
- 32% performance improvement over single-source

### Multi-Horizon
- 7 prediction horizons per pair
- Serves scalpers, day traders, swing traders
- Consensus signals from multiple horizons

### Comprehensive Features
- Test ALL 8,214+ features before selection
- NO shortcuts (90%+ requires comprehensive testing)
- Select optimal 50-100 features per model

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### These documents are AUTHORITATIVE

- Supersede conflicting information in other docs
- Represent final architectural decisions
- Must be consulted before major changes

### Updates require justification

- Cannot change architecture without strong rationale
- Performance data must support alternatives
- User approval required for deviations

### Implementation must align

- Scripts must follow these specifications
- Tables must match the inventory
- Models must use the dual architecture
