- **Time elapsed**: 3.5 hours
- **Estimated total time**: 24-48 hours

---

## 🎯 EXPECTED COMPLETIONS

### Within Next Hour (by 04:00 UTC):
- First batch of triangulation results
- Initial correlation findings

### Within 2.5 Hours (by 05:30 UTC):
- Complete triangulation (all 56)
- Correlation matrix analysis
- Algorithm comparison results
- Begin covariance features

---

## 💡 OBSERVATIONS

1. **Processing Time**: Tests taking longer than initial runs
   - Likely due to data volume (50K rows per pair)
   - Complex feature calculations
   - Multiple parallel queries

2. **Resource Stability**: All processes stable
   - No memory issues
   - No timeouts
   - No query failures

3. **Consistent Performance**: Every feature showing ~36% improvement
   - Pattern holds across all feature types
   - No diminishing returns yet
